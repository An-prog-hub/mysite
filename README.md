**Features:**
- Uses a [React hook](https://github.com/alii/use-lanyard) for [Lanyard](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard) to fetch what I'm currently listening to on Spotify
- Fetches my top Github repositories, as well as my total stars/forks count using [ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration)
- Utilizes Discord webhooks to receive messages from those who fill out the contact form
- Uses TailwindCSS, for easy light/dark theme configuration
